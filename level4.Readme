Honestly not quite sure what this one was all about.
I guess its about showing that a router has multiple interfaces for each subnet?

Well we are given 2 fixed interfaces for a router
R3	IP:90.168.115.244	Mask: 255.255.255.192
R2	IP:90.168.115.1		Mask: 255.255.255.128
We are also given a free interface in the router R1
And two PC interfaces, one of which 
A1 has a fixed IP: 90.168.115.132

Now looking at this we notice, that we need to put the two PCs in the same subnet.
So that means, the same Masks, and IPs in the same range.
Also, we will need exactly one (1) router interface in that Subnet.

Now looking at this we can see, that router R2 and PC A1 have a very similar fixed IP
90.168.115.1 and 90.168.115.132

So it could be usefull to use R2s subnet to connect our PCs to the router.

However, if we want to connect with R2, we need the same Subnet Mask.
And if we appply the Subnet Mask to A1, we can see, that we have 2 possible subnets for our IPs.
And sadly, R2 is in the first one, and A2 is in the second one.

R2: 90.168.115.1	is in .1-.126
A1: 90.168.115.132	is in .129-.254

This means, that we cannot connect to this router.

So lets use the free router, to amend this.

We will give the free router a small IP from the range, that A1 is in.
I will go with 129 (90.168.115.127)
Of course, we will also need the same Subnet Mask as in R2

Now if we give the same Subnet Mask to A1, we get
R1: 90.168.115.129	255.255.255.128
A1: 90.168.115.132	255.255.255.128

And this should allow us to create a connection between the Router and A1

Now we just need to put B1 in the same Subnet as well.
So we just pick another number from our Subnets Data Range.
I noticed when picking mine, that there seems to be a some limiting factor,
which only allowed numbers between 130 and 191.
This is probably due to the R3 router interfering, since it would be in the range
90.168.115.192 to 90.168.115.255

So just make sure the number you choose doesnt interfere with the other routers.

So I chose 191, cause I am politically extreme, I like living on the edge to danger.
