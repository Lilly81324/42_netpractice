Alright, interfacing between PCs is cool, but I cannot get my cute pictures of animals without the internet.

So now lets connect to a website!

For this exercise I get a website I that routes through a fixed gate 163.172.250.12.
An interface on a router R2 for that website with fixed IP and Mask:
IP: 163.172.250.12
Mask: 255.255.255.240
A router interface R that routes to a fixed gate 163.172.250.1
A different router interface R1 with a fixed Mask 255.255.255.128
And a PC A1 interface with a fixed IP 83.110.5.227

First things first, set our PC A1 to the mask from R1.
So 255.255.255.128 or /25

Now get the smallest possible valid IP adress for our routers IP, so that it is still in A1s subnet.
CIDR 25 -> 32-25=7 host bits -> 2^7=128 IPs -> 
x.0 - x.127 
and x.128 - x.255
227 is in the second range.
So we use 83.110.5.129.

Now lets route our PC onto the internet.
Since we dont know what adress our PC wants to move to, we will use the default route.
Our gate will be our PCs subnet interfaces IP.
So we get:
default => 83.110.5.129

Yes, technically we could connect to a specific IP if we knew it.
But in this case we dont. 163.172.250.12 is the routers IP.
And 163.172.250.1 might only be another router or server, not the final website.
So it is muuuch easier to just send our request to our ISP, and let them figure things out.
This is what you pay for, after all.
They keep track of routing, and will get you to the website you want, so you just need to fall back on their services.

Now onto our website. In order for it to be able to send back packets, we need to tell it, where.
So we tell it, that in order to reach back to our PC, it needs to go through its own subnet.
So we say:
83.110.5.227/25 => 163.172.250.12
So now our website knows how to send packets back to our PC.

Now onto the last thing. The websites router.
Since its the websites, it should always redirect to the next step towards the website. (163.172.250.1)
For the gate, so the final target, we dont know what exactly the IP is, so we will just call the default rule.
That means we will parse our traffick that comes to this router to the next device, 
without worrying about having to define the websites final IP adress.
