Now things are getting complicated, but dont worry, this is nothing new.
We are just doing what we did before with more devices.
Its still connecting machines through routers using Sub- and Supernetting.

Fixed:
Router interface towards A and B called R11 with Mask 255.255.255.128
Router R1 route default => 163.172.250.1
Router R1 interface R12 towards Website: 163.172.250.12 255.255.255.240
Three half fixed routing rules for the website, each with the gate of 163.172.250.12
A half fixed routing rule for the router R2, with the route of 0.0.0.0/0
Mask for the router R2 for C and D on the R1-R2 side is 255.255.255.252
Mask for router R2 interface R23 towards D1 is /18
C has half fixed route with route 0.0.0.0/0
D has half fixed route with gate 93.204.111.166

So, lets fill out what is already basically fixed.
Our D always hops next to 93.204.111.166, meaning that this is the Ip for the next step towards outside.
So that will be the IP for R23, as it is the interface for D.
R23: 93.204.111.166/18

We also want to establish a more general connection to the internet, nut just one IP.
So we set Ds route to:
default => 93.204.111.166

Now for D we will use R23s subnet Mask /18 and then put it in the same net, but different subnet.
So pick any IP between (24-18=6, 2^6=64, Round Down(111/64) = 1)
93.204.(1*64).1 - 93.204.(2*64-1).254
93.204.64.1 - 93.204.127.254

Next up, lets connect D and C so we can fulfill the second goal.
They should be in a different subnet, so that they can have two different interfaces.
For simplicities sake, I chose the same subnet mask and the next biggest IP range
93.204.128.1 - 93.204.191.254
Lets go with 
R22: 93.204.128.1/18
C1: 93.204.128.2/18
Finish our connection of, by routing C towards our router with a default rule:
C route: 0.0.0.0/0 => 93.204.128.1

Now we should have D and C connected and the goal should be fulfilled.
Lets connect them to the internet, so they can watch their Linux Tech Tips.

For R21 we already have a Mask of .252, which means we only get 4 IPs for this subnet, 
with 2 valid and usable ones.
So since we use 
93.204 = x
x.64.1 - x.191.254
I chose the next bigger range, which will be.
x.192.0 - x.192.4 (with extremes)
So we can give our R21:
93.204.192.1
And we will put R13 in the same subnet for a connection, so it will get the other IP.
IP: 93.204.192.2 Mask: /30 or 255.255.255.252

Then lets tell our R2, to direct any default traffic towards R1:
0.0.0.0/0 => 93.204.192.2

So now we should have a one way connection from C and D towards the internet.
Lets bring those packets home.

The internet does not have a rule, by which to send our packages to our network.
But it has premade rules to send things to R1, which is in the right direction.
So we will hijack one of theese rules to direct trafick to D and C.
So we simply neeed to tell the roule, that the route will be towards the Network Adress,
of the subnet from C and from D.
Ds Network Address is 93.204.64.0/18 (as it is the lowest possible IP in that Subnet)
Cs Network Address is 93.204.128.0/18
So we will set the internets routes to:
93.204.64.0/18		=> 163.172.250.12
93.204.64.128/18	=> 163.172.250.12

Now we are one step closer, our packages now hopped to R1, but R1 does not know what to do with them.
This is because the route / target is not part of R1s subnets, but R2s.
So we do the same thing as in the internet, telling it to redirect to R2:
93.204.64.0/18		=> 93.204.192.1
93.204.64.128/18	=> 93.204.192.1

And boom, packages for C and D have arrived.

-----------

Now onto B and A.
Since they are not connected via Router, but via Switch, they will have to be in the same subnet.
We have the fixed Mask 255.255.255.128, meaning we get the ranges x.1-x.126 or x.129-x.254

I like them small, so I will use x.1 for the routers interface.
x.2 for A1 and x.3 for B1.
Now, what should our IP network be?
There is nothing fixed or predefined, so as long as we dont use private or existing ones, any network will be fine.
So lets go with 100.100.100.0
So:
B1: 100.100.100.3/25
A1: 100.100.100.2/25
R11:100.100.100.1/25

Routing:
B: default => 100.100.100.1
A: default => 100.100.100.1

Now we should have a connection to the other PCs, and a one-way to the internet.
Route our internet back to our 100.100.100.0/25 network and you are done.
100.100.100.0 => 163.172.250.12
